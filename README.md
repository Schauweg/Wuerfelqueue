This is a simple programm which lets you select a random champion in the League of Legends champion select.

## How to use it?

When being in the champion select, wait until its your turn to choose a champion. Once there simply press the "RANDOMIZE CHAMPION" button and it will choose a random one from your owned champions.  
The "Auto-Confirm Champion" checkbox simply lets you choose, whether you want the programm to also confirm the champion or just hover it.
